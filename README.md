Liquidity Pool Management with Uniswap on Ethereum
This repository contains a script written in JavaScript using Hardhat for managing liquidity pools on the Ethereum network. The script interacts with the Uniswap decentralized exchange to add liquidity between USDC (USD Coin), DAI (Dai Stablecoin), and WETH (Wrapped Ether).

USDCAddress: Address of the USDC token contract.
DAIAddress: Address of the DAI token contract.
WETHAddress: Address of the WETH token contract.
UniSwapRouter: Address of the Uniswap Router contract.
USDCHolder: Ethereum address to impersonate for interacting with the Uniswap Router.
Uniswap Router Functions
The script utilizes two main functions from the Uniswap Router contract:

    function addLiquidityETH(
        address token,
        uint amountTokenDesired,
        uint amountTokenMin,
        uint amountETHMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external payable returns (uint amountToken, uint amountETH, uint liquidity);

    function addLiquidity(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint amountADesired,
        uint amountBDesired,
        uint amountAMin,
        uint amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB, uint liquidity);

Liquidity Pool Management with Uniswap on Ethereum
This repository contains a script written in JavaScript using Hardhat for managing liquidity pools on the Ethereum network. The script interacts with the Uniswap decentralized exchange to add liquidity between USDC (USD Coin), DAI (Dai Stablecoin), and WETH (Wrapped Ether).

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
Hardhat Ethereum development environment set up
Access to an Ethereum node
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
Usage
Configuration
Modify the main function in script.js to customize the following parameters:

USDCAddress: Address of the USDC token contract.
DAIAddress: Address of the DAI token contract.
WETHAddress: Address of the WETH token contract.
UniSwapRouter: Address of the Uniswap Router contract.
USDCHolder: Ethereum address to impersonate for interacting with the Uniswap Router.
Uniswap Router Functions
The script utilizes two main functions from the Uniswap Router contract:

addLiquidityETH:

javascript
Copy code
function addLiquidityETH(
    address token,
    uint amountTokenDesired,
    uint amountTokenMin,
    uint amountETHMin,
    address to,
    uint deadline
) external payable returns (uint amountToken, uint amountETH, uint liquidity);
Adds liquidity to a pool with ETH and a specified ERC-20 token.

addLiquidity:

javascript
Copy code
function addLiquidity(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint amountADesired,
    uint amountBDesired,
    uint amountAMin,
    uint amountBMin,
    address to,
    uint deadline
) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB, uint liquidity);
Adds liquidity to a pool with two different ERC-20 tokens.


Impersonation
The script utilizes the Hardhat Toolbox to impersonate an Ethereum account (USDCHolder) for interacting with the Uniswap Router. Impersonation allows the script to perform transactions on behalf of the specified account.

Transaction Details

Impersonates the specified Ethereum account.
Approves the Uniswap Router to spend USDC and DAI on behalf of the impersonated account.
Displays the ETH and DAI balances before the liquidity pool deployment.
Adds liquidity to the USDC-DAI pool using the Uniswap Router.
Displays the updated ETH and DAI balances after the liquidity pool deployment.# Uniswap-Mainnet-Forking-Script-
